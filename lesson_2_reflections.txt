What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository a new .git repository was added in the directory where I initialized the repository.  Initializing a repository is important if I want to create a file history by commiting changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows the user to commit multiple files in one commit while those "untracked files" can only be commited one at a time.  The benefit of staging areas is it can make the file history look "cleaner" and a lot less cluttered with commits.  Also staging areas can possibly reduce the amount of time needed to make commits.
